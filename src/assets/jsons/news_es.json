Menos aún en escenarios de un cambio tan acelerado como el que vivimos en estos tiempos de pandemia. Así ocurre en Medicina y otras Ciencias de la Salud, acumulándose las evidencias con tendencias de crecimiento exponencial. Analizaremos aspectos que consideramos fundamentales para el cambio que nos va a tocar vivir y, en muchos casos, protagonizar, pero no solo a los profesionales sanitarios… Las reglas de la sanidad las van a reescribir los individuos, sean pacientes, asegurados, clientes, familiares, consumidores o cualquier otra forma de aproximación a la misma. Ya ha ocurrido en otros sectores y la sanidad no es una excepción.</p><p>La capacidad y competencia en la toma de decisiones (o no) y las decisiones individuales informadas (o no) son las que marcan el futuro de la sanidad. Son nuevas formas de aproximarse a la información médica, nuevas formas de interaccionar con los profesionales sanitarios o entre sí, nuevas formas de gestionar sus datos médicos, nuevas formas de tomar decisiones.</p><iframe title='Julián Isla - Cursos de Verano UMA 2021 (Málaga)' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrbEFLytnUY?feature=oembed' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen='' width='800' height='450' frameborder='0'></iframe><p>En fundación 29 al ser una fundación sin ánimo de lucro lo que intentamos es estimular a la sociedad en cómo habría que generar nuevos sistemas y nuevas herramientas de apoyo la toma de decisión.

With this, using systems that analyze this information and learn from it, we can draw new relevant conclusions regarding health, which is undoubtedly a benefit for medicine in general, and in particular for the patient.</p><p>The patient, on the other hand, has more and more control over his health data. A few months ago we attended a working session exclusively devoted to the concept of sharing these data in order to accelerate research, drugs development and knowledge about a particular disease. Was this event promoted by the clinical or pharmaceutical community?.No!. It was a patient´s organization, very active for years, which managed to bring together clinicians, industry representatives, researchers and regulators to create a “manifesto” which captures black on white that patients are the owners of their data and that they want to share them to advance the knowledge and treatment of their disease.</p><p>The premise for data to be useful is that they can be shared. To be shareable, they have to be protected. The confidentiality of data in health history is one of the main challenges of health systems in general. We need new ways to manage the data and trace the creation of value: its origin, custody and secondary uses. The ability to access to large data sets will be key to developing expert systems. But access to these data sets has to be achieved by protecting the rights of patients and preserving their anonymity.</p><p>The new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives patients unprecedented power over their data rights. We need to take this opportunity and generate new mechanisms that allow data to flow safely. As an example of practical application of the concepts underpinning GDPR: the old model where the hospital was the main responsible for the custody of the data will cease to be, as patients can now go to their Health Center and inmediately reclaim their data in a digital format.</p><p>This will certainly be a giant step towards the new way of doing medicine.

A new treatment for cancer, a new method for a transplant, a drug that can cure hepatitis, a robot that operates at a distance, etc.  That has caused us to have the false conviction that Medicine can work miracles.  Without a doubt it can, and the great advances that have taken place in medicine in the last two centuries are unquestionable.  But it is also true that most of the medical acts performed in the world are done simply with the clinical judgment of the doctor, with no other help than his experience, his training and his intuition.</p><p>This way of performing medicine fortunately works for that vast majority of clinical events in the countries around us.  We have one of the best systems of medical training in the university and a program of practices and learning that has been perfected over the years.  It is a very solid system for most of the medical needs of citizens.</p><p>But  when you face a serious illness like a Rare Disease this system finds its limits quickly.  When this professional has to face a disease that may have never seen or that has seen few cases, is elusive and does not face all their symptoms, when the treatments are simply symptomatic and of course none of them capable of curing the disease and when the lack of diagnosis is a problem not only for the patient but for the doctor himself, we realize that the system is not designed to respond to these.</p><p>How is it possible that in the 21st century the diagnostic process is done manually? There are about 7,000 rare diseases and more than 14,000 symptoms. Do patients really expect their doctor to know how to navigate through all this range of possibilities with only his experience and clinical eye?  We take the car to the car repair shop and data on the car key are read and a data collector is connected to our car.  In just a few minutes they have more data than we can have on our health. Even the automatic diagnosis system warns of breakdowns, possible problems and suggests solutions.  However, we are putting our medical professionals, with years of training, in front of the patients with a computer, which they do not use to get suggestions of new possibilities, but just as a sophisticated typewriter, on which they have to complete hundreds of fields with data that do not help to make better medicine for their patient but are only usted to satisfy the administrative needs of your hospital.</p><p>We want our doctors to use their valuable time with their patients, so that instead of looking at the keyboard, they can look them in the face, see how they dress, what they feel and how they tell what happens to them and so that they can think about which treatment is better and if the patient will follow it. Instead of a sophisticated word processor on their computer we want a tool that helps them to make better decisions.  For all of this we have done Dx29, with the hope that our professionals can make better medicine with the data.</p><p>Rather than empowering patients, we have to re-empower physicians.</p><p>Author: Julián Isla is President and Founder of Foundation 29.

Today´s available technology -and all what is to come- will allow physicians and all health professionals to have very important supports thanks to Genomics, AI or Telemedicine, which together with the massive Data Management (Big Data) are going to help us reduce failure risk and  highly increase the chances of success in the Diagnosis, in addition to causing a wonderful “side effect” which directly benefits patients: we will be able to look into their eyes instead of a screen.</p><p>But high quality information is needed however. In other words, to achieve these new capacities the Data must be correctly digitized (far beyond basics like moving from paper to pdf without being able to take any advantage of what it contains) and organized, with transparency – without incurring bioethical conflicts –, uniform and as automated as possible,  so that the doctor or any other healthcare personnel can give  whole attention to the direct care of the patient, true purpose of Medicine (in Capitals).</p><p>A patient who, in addition to benefiting from an “Augmented” Doctor, thanks to those same technological advances will take a much more relevant role in the management of their Health, providing their own data and actively participating in the prevention and treatment of the disease. More than Artificial Intelligence, we will need Extended Intelligence.</p><p>It’s time for change. It is time to return to the origin of the medical vocation: to take better care of patients.

Doctors have to get the right term and the help tools simply offer a linguistic approximation help.</p><p>The second is the precision of the phenotype. If the description is very generic or on the contrary it is very deep the searching algorithms of associated diseases can not find precise similarities.</p><p>And the last one is that there are conditions like autism in which the symptoms are purely behavioral. Are perfect Proms (Patient Reported Outcomes) that the doctor has to obtain by asking the patient’s parents or caregivers. We have had to develop a new strategy to get these symptoms.</p><p>Now we are finishing to outline this algorithm and test it with control patients. We hope to have results soon.</p>"

Friday afternoon has given us a time of general madness and laughters. By the way, one of the goals of this foundation is to have fun while we are working. I, of course, am fulfilling it to the letter.</p><p>In the photo you can see how the team, in the end, has enjoyed a moment of silence. Above the sound of the keys you could almost hear the machinery of the brains running. How much talent is concentrated in 2 square meters.</p>"

Today we have had the pleasure of meeting one of the leading companies in the world of rare diseases, <a href='https://www.shire.com/'>Shire</a>. We have discussed the different approaches to diagnosis and how to combine efforts to facilitate this option to the whole world. We have presented the idea of the <a href='https://www.globalrarediseasecommission.com/'>Global Commission</a> who are leading with Eurordis and Microsoft in order to define the famous “Patient Journey” from which the whole world is talking about. </p><p>As always, we do the demo of H29, we had our “wow” moment that convinces me more and more that we are on the right path.</p><p>The best of the day see how after so much virtual meeting and remote access, we can work for a few days together physically and assess the human quality of the group we have assembled. We were just missing Sacha.</p><p>Intense days and a lot of debate, but very gratifying too!</p><p>I am convinced that the best is yet to come <img src='https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/1f61b.svg' alt='😛'></p><p>Javier Castrejón</p>"

One of the many he had. The period we live in from these seizures started until we had a diagnosis of Dravet’s syndrome, it was the worst of our lives. By giving him an incorrect medication, Sergio had so many seizures a day that we stopped counting them. There were days he could have dozens.</p><p>The objective of the diagnosis has revolved in these nine years in our lives. First with the genetic test for Dravet syndrome we started with the hospital La Paz. Then with the implantation of the bioinformatics unit and very recently with the emergence of new technology as the artificial intelligence that will change everything.</p><p>From Foundation 29 we started this initiative with the hope of generating patient-centric technology that would shorten this time. We will generate a tool that allows to make phenotyping (symptom extraction) and Genotyping (full genomic analysis) with precision and depth.</p><p>Our goal to contribute to that time to have a diagnosis if you have a rare disease will shorten as much as possible and that will only be possible if patients, doctors, researchers and engineers work together. Will you join us?</p>"
